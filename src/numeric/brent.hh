    /*! \brief Root finding by Brent's method.
     *
     * Brent's method employs Newton-Raphson method to converge to a root,
     * but falls back to a simpler but more robust bi-section method when
     * the guess by Newton method falls outside the known bounds.
     *
     * \param f The function to solve for.
     * \param df Derivative of f.
     * \param x1 Left bound of interval to search.
     * \param x2 Right bound of interval to search.
     * \param y0 Value function f should atain.
     * \param epsilon Absolute error.
     *
     * Newton's method uses the derivative of f to guess the next value:
     *      \f[ x_{i+1} = x_{i} - \Delta y / f'(x_{i}) \f]
     * If the function is not so nice to us -- it may be rapidly changing,
     * but more importantly, we could be mucking about in the exponential tail
     * of a distribution -- this method will behave bad, so we back it up
     * with a bisection method, which always converges.
